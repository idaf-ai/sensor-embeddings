# Sensor Embeddings to improve recognition

Data collection and retrieval has come a long way in the past few years. Wearable technology, such as smart watches, and even mobile phones collect massive amounts of user data. However, this data can be difficult to work with due to the size and complexity. 

One option is to use dimensionality reduction in order to reduce the features represented in the data without reducing the efficiency of our model. We will use the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset to test different forms of dimensionality reduction. Our initial plan is to use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce the datasetâ€™s feature size, although we will look into other possible methods as well.
